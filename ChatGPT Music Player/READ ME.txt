MP3 Player
This program is an MP3 player built with Python's Pygame library that plays MP3 files from a user-selected folder. 
The program displays the currently playing MP3 file and provides options to play, pause, skip, and change the current MP3 file.

Getting Started
To run the program, navigate to the directory where the Executable is saved and run it

A file dialog will appear asking you to select a folder containing MP3 files. 
Once you have selected a folder, the program will load the first MP3 file in the folder and display the file name on the window.

To play the MP3 file, click the play button. 
To pause the MP3 file, click the pause button. 
To skip to the next MP3 file in the folder, click the skip button. 
To play the previous MP3 file in the folder, click the previous button. 
To play the next MP3 file in the folder, click the next button.
You may also change the background by adding a png image into the executable folder and renaming it to background. The file will not run without it
The background must be atleast 400 by 150 to work properly

The program will automatically loop back to the beginning of the folder once it has reached the end of the list of MP3 files.

Acknowledgments
This program was built using the Pygame library, which was created by a community of developers led by Pete Shinners.
This program was created with the help from ChatGPT. I asked it to built me parts of the code and worked from there.
Its actually a viable way to learn to code as it gives information to you directly. I could not dream of making something like this earlier today.
